# Solar Power Project Description
Solar power is an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels. However, the amount
of solar energy (as measured in kilowatt hours - kWh) can vary widely depending upon various
factors such as season, angle of panels, direction of the sun, cloud cover, etc. Further, the solar
panels themselves degrade over time such that the power output decreases over years of use. The
KWH dataset contains daily power generated from a single solar panel system on a single customer
household. The power company would like to use the data to understand:

1. How the panels are degrading over time,

2. How many years till the panels have lost 50% of their power generating capability (on
average); and

3. Obtain projections of power for the next year.
